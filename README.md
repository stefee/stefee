### Hello 🌷

- 🔭 I’m currently working mostly on private projects at [KTech](https://ktech.com/) / [Kobalt Music](https://www.kobaltmusic.com/).
- 👯‍♀️ I’m looking to contribute back to the community projects I use, to help keep them accessible and pain-free!
- ✏️ I'm also writing some blog posts which are published on [dev.to](https://dev.to/stefee) and my [personal website](https://stef.sh).
- 🦀 I’m currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- 🤲 I don't do work for free - when I do contribute to open-source software it is done in-work hours or to satisfy my curiosity.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefee/) or the email on my website [stef.sh](https://stef.sh).
